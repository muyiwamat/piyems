    <h2>Unhappy Cats Reclaiming the Backstreets</h2>
    <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7015/6572196991_c827f8025f_z.jpg" alt="Unhappy Cats Reclaiming the Backstreets"/>
    <p>
    The pesky dogs are back, and they are taking over the streets! The cats need your help to
    reclaim the backstreets and get rid of the dogs once and for all!  Rid the backstreets of
    unpleasant howls and barks that upset the neighbours, replacing them with peaceful, soothing,
    purrs of contented cats.  
    Featuring several new and challenging puzzles set around the backstreets of Cymric City,
    it'll take all your ingenuity to devise cunning traps, tricking the dogs into cages that
    they can be sent back to the pound.  
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have any difficulties during the game, for a small charge of five pounds through
    in-game purchasing, you can call in the &quot;Dog Squad&quot; a crack team of dog catchers.
    These guys and gals are at the top of their game, capable of capturing any rogue dog, regardless of how clever they are.
    </p>

    App permissions: obtaining your location, to change the character dialects to be local to you;
    voice recording, to allow you to add your own voice to the characters; camera, to allow you to
    import real world objects into the game, to help with your quest; network access, to download
    fixes to the thousands of bugs you will probably encounter; and lots more, but you'll have to figure those out for yourself.

    <h2>F1 Car Designer</h2>
    <img src="http://img47.imageshack.us/img47/7747/iwetoyota1an7.jpg" alt="F1 Car Designer"/>
    <p>
    You've seen them on TV! You've maybe even seen them in real life!
    You wish you could have one yourself, to speed through that morning commute to work! Well,
    we cannot quite give you that.  Instead, we offer you the next best thing: the ability to
    custom design your own F1 car, which, through the magic of 3D printing, we can produce for
    you, for a small fee.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    F1 cars are at the cutting edge of vehicular technology,
    constructed from composites of carbon fibre and similar ultra-lightweight materials,
    they feature a single-seat, open cockpit design, with substantial front and rear wings,
    and an engine positioned behind the driver.  Formula One cars use semi-automatic sequential gearboxes,
    with seven forward gears and one reverse gear, with real-wheel drive.  The gearbox is constructed of carbon titanium,
    as heat dissipation is a critical issue, and is bolted onto the back of the engine.  Optional extras that
    you can add include  systems such as full automatic transmission, launch control and traction control.
    All aspects of the engine can be modified/customised in this unique app.</p>

    <p>
    The steering wheel is one of the most advanced anywhere in the world,
    and you have the opportunity to design it to your own specification.
    The wheel allows the driver  to fine tune many elements of the race car from
    within the machine using the steering wheel. The wheel can be used to change gears,
    apply rev. limiter, adjust fuel/air mix, change brake pressure, and call the radio.
    Data such as engine rpm, lap times, speed, and gear is displayed on an LCD screen.
    The wheel hub will also incorporate gear change paddles and a row of LED shift lights.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You also have the ability to design many other features of the design.
    These include features that directly affect the aerodynamics of the car,
    a vital component of ensuring success.  These include the wings: attaching
    them to the suspension or fixed to the chassis; the addition of aerofoils,
    with the ability to specify how raised the nose is above the centre of the front aerofoil;
    customise the shape of the both front and rear wings bargeboards, side pods, underbody, and rear diffuser.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note, cars will be produced using the latest 3D printing technology,
    at a scale of 1:50; the car will not actually work as a car.

    <h2>Later &#45; I have singing to do</h2>
    <img src="http://www.katiejoyce.com/files/QuickSiteImages/KaraokeSinger.gif" alt="Later app"/>
    <p>
    Everybody loves singing along with their favourite artist or song and now you can do it
    using just your phone!  Forget about that important job you have been dreading &#45; instead
    enjoy yourself with some karaoke.  Since originating in Japan many years ago, karaoke has became
    a world wide phenomia that has taken the world by storm.  The word itself comes from the Japanese
    words Karappo meaning empty and Okesutura meaning orchestra, to give Empty Orchestra, just waiting
    for your voice.   Karaoke has evolved since its days in clubs in Japan, where groups of youngsters
    would meet up and enjoy singing the night away together.  The production of home karaoke machines
    brought the pleasure of listening to your friend/family destroy you favourite song right into your living room.
    Now, this app brings it right into the palm of your hand.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Along with an extensive list of song, available for download from our website, you can also sing along
    to any audio file you have one your phone.  All you have to do is select a song from your library,
    and it will be played, along with a visualisation, and the words.  Just like the karaoke machines you are used to,
    as the song continues, each word is highlighted, with varying speed depending on the rhythm of the song.
    Selecting a song from your own library that you do not have the lyrics for&#63;  No problem&#33;
    Our app allows you to enter the lyrics, and, by the wonders of technology, we will automatically
    determine which words you should be singing when.  Too lazy to enter the lyrics yourself&#63;
    Simply use the &quot;Get Lyrics&quot; button, to go online and download the lyrics automatically
    (it tests, the app selects the correct lyrics 86.3&#37; of the time, with no need for input from yourself).
    While you are singing along, why not record yourself&#63; If you think you have done a good job,
    you can share your recording with your friends via social media plugins for Facebook, Twitter, etc.
    Put together a good dance routine&#63; Use your phone's camera to record it, and post it to youtube&#33;.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    App permissions: obtaining your location to warn others that you are in the area
    and singing and they may want to avoid you&#59; microphone to record your wonderful talents&#59;

    how much effort you are putting into the dance, and record the volume of voice based on sound
    waves passing through the air&#59; accounts to enable sharing with your friends and family&#59;
