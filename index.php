               The pesky dogs are back, and they are taking over the streets! The cats need
               your help to reclaim the backstreets and get rid of the dogs once and for all!
               Rid the backstreets of unpleasant howls and barks that upset the neighbours,
               replacing them with peaceful, soothing, purrs of contented cats.  
               Featuring several new and challenging puzzles set around the backstreets of Cymric City,
               it'll take all your ingenuity to devise cunning traps, tricking the dogs into cages that
               they can be sent back to the pound.

               You've seen them on TV! You've maybe even seen them in real life!
               You wish you could have one yourself, to speed through that morning
               commute to work! Well, we cannot quite give you that.  Instead, we offer
               you the next best thing: the ability to custom design your own F1 car, which,
               through the magic of 3D printing, we can produce for you, for a small fee.

               Since originating in Japan many years ago, karaoke has became a world wide phenomia
               that has taken the world by storm.
